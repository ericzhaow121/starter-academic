Social engagement is a critical component of healthy ageing. This project aims to investigate creative practices in the use of digital technologies to maintain the social engagement of older adults living independently, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic when engaging in social activities becomes difficult. With a focus on the activities and practices supported by digital tools, this project aims to contribute to the field of Human-computer Interaction by investigating how technologies are being used by older adults in the context of independent living and factors affecting their experiences of using technologies. Findings from the study will inform the design of new technology-based systems or programs for older people living independently.
