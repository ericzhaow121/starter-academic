abstract: "While VR has shown benefits such as improving alertness, recalling
  memories and cognitive training for older adults, it is challenging to deploy
  it in aged care settings due to the complexity of social care, physical and
  healthcare needs of the residents. This paper presents a two-phase study that
  aims to explore the challenges of deploying VR technology in aged care
  settings. Phase one involved a thematic analysis of video recordings of 14 VR
  sessions, during which five residents of an aged care facility were invited to
  experience and interact with VR systems. Phase two aimed to explore the
  challenges further by analyzing semi-structured interviews with 11 staff
  members who had experience in coordinating VR activities in aged care homes.
  The results revealed a range of issues that need to be considered when
  deploying VR systems in aged care settings, including: usability issues
  related to VR systems; barriers caused by residentsâ€™ mobility constraints;
  physical discomfort; and challenges in providing guidance and support for
  residents using VR."
